# CEP Search

## Description

CEP Search is an application that enables users to search for Brazilian addresses by entering a CEP (postal code). By utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application fetches data from the API [Via CEP](https://viacep.com.br/) and displays relevant address information.

This project provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter a CEP and quickly obtain details about the corresponding address, including the street name, neighborhood, city, state, and other relevant information.

Whether you need to quickly find an address or integrate address lookup functionality into your own projects, CEP Search offers a simple and efficient solution.
