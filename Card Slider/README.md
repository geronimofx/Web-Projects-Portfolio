# Card Slider

## Description

The Card Slider project is a dynamic card slider that allows users to navigate through cards by clicking on the side arrow buttons or by dragging the mouse over the cards. It provides an interactive and visually appealing way to showcase content.

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the card slider functionality. In the JavaScript implementation, the following concepts were studied and applied:

- `forEach`: Used to iterate over an array of elements and perform operations on each element.
- `querySelector`: Used to select the first element that matches a specific CSS selector.
- `querySelectorAll`: Used to select all elements that match a specific CSS selector.
- Spread syntax in JavaScript: Used to expand an array into individual elements.
- `addEventListener`: Used to attach event handlers to elements, enabling interactivity.

To create this card slider, you can refer to the tutorial on YouTube by CodingNepal: [Create A Draggable Card Sliderl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QE8dXq9SOE&ab_channel=CodingNepal).

Experience the smooth and engaging card slider and impress your users with an interactive content showcase.
